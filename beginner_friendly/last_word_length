```
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.

//I tried to not use any built in methods just to challenge myself

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLastWord = function (s) {
  counter = 0;
  let word_begin = false;
  for (let i = s.length; i > 0; i--) {
    if (s[i - 1] != " ") {
      //just to skip the first space if encountered
      word_begin = true;
      counter += 1;
    }

    if (word_begin == true && s[i - 1] == " ") {
      break;
    }
  }
  return counter;
};

//Best solution
var lengthOfLastWord = function (s) {
  let trimmedString = s.trim();

  return trimmedString.length - trimmedString.lastIndexOf(" ") - 1;
};
